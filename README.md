# Hi!
This is my version of the Ray Tracing engine implemented in [this YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl) by The Cherno. Much of the code is his, and I'm following his style conventions, so this won't look like my code in terms of docs and style. I have however added some features myself, including in particular anti-aliasing and the ability to add new materials and objects to the scene. My pace of development has basically been dictated by when he decides to release new episodes though, since I don't want to get so far out of sync I can no longer follow along with what he does.
